### A small competetion data exporter and visualiser for the coach of our gymnastics team.

This is a simple project a friend and I are takning part in. The basic idea is to have a simple native applicationto get the STB male league data and process it for ease of use and access. Since the data is loaded on the page dynamically on each request this entails this use of a headless browser to load the page properly and then extract the data. Furthermore the data is kept in a local database and processed via pandas and matplotlib.
